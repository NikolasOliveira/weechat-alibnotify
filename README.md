# WeeChat Growl Script

This is a [Growl](http://growl.info) script for [WeeChat](http://weechat.org/) Internet Relay Chat client.

**NOTE**: This is still a work in progress. If you want complete functionality and willing to use [Irssi](http://irssi.org/) instead, see my complete [Irssi Growl](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/irssi-growl) script.

## Installation

Make sure that the Growl Pythong bindings are installed.

    sudo pip install py-Growl

Move *growl.py* to *~/.weechat/python/autoload/growl.py* and an *icon.png* to *~/.weechat/icon.png*.
